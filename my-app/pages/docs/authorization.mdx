The **Gaming Platform API** uses token-based authentication for secure access.

## Authentication Method

To access the API, you need to use an **API Key**. Follow these steps to authenticate:

1. Register your account on the platform.
2. Once logged in, navigate to the **API Settings** page.
3. Generate your **API Key**.

## Using the API Key

You need to pass the API key in the `Authorization` header of each request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.example.com/endpoint
